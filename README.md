# YelpCamp
##A Yelp-copy for campingsites. 
With full authorization, register and login a user.  
Create/add a campingsite with name, price, image, description.  
Where users can leave reviews. Save everything to a DB.  

###Used: 
* MongoDB/Mongoose  
* ExpressJS  
* NodeJS  
* Passport  

A work in progress...  
Will probably update the design and maybe change the direction from campingsites to something else...
